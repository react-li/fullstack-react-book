# BuildingProductHunt



In this chapter, you’re going to get a crash course on React by building a simple voting application inspired by [Product Hunt3](https://www.producthunt.com/). 
You’ll become familiar with how React approaches front-end develop- ment and all of the fundamentals necessary to build an interactive React app from start to finish. 
Thanks to React’s core simplicity, by the end of the chapter you’ll already be well on your way to writing a variety of fast, dynamic interfaces.
We’ll focus on getting our React app up and running fast. We take a deeper look at concepts covered in this section throughout the course.
